Social Network(OOP + DB + GUI)


I use intelliji as IDE and here I will write helpfull notes to make the app running:
1. don't forget to clean and to build gradle.
2. use java fx at project type including
3. don't forget to link database at build.gradle file dependencies implementation 'org.postgresql:postgresql:42.7.1'
4. use ctrl + alt + L to reformat code


Tips:
-check the data in the tables when working with db
An enum is a special "class" in Java used to define a set of constants.
E extends Event = with any event type that implements the Event interface
fetches= a aduce
model = ObservableList
